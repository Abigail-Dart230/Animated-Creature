      <p>
          The Night Crawler is a creature who only shows its face when the moon is bright. The eratcic creature is always searching for food to feast on. 
          <br> The Night Crawler is blind on his left eye, however it makes up for this through his right eye that is constantly moving in all directions.
          <br> The bright moon enhances his right eyes's vision but on nights when the full moon shines brightest, it does the unthinkable.
          <br> The full moon will take the shape of the Night Crawler's left eye and it will be able to all that the moonlight touches.
          <br> With its large mouth, the Night Crawler will devour anything that can fit.
          <br> All creatures will hide in the night of a bright full moon.
